 Titanic Dataset Analysis - Project Guide
 **Project Overview:**
In this project, you will explore the Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers who were aboard the Titanic. The goal of this project is to perform an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using **Pandas** for data manipulation and **Matplotlib**/**Seaborn** for data visualization. By the end of the project, you will have a deeper understanding of the dataset and learn how to answer key questions related to passenger survival, demographics, and other factors.

 **Project Requirements:**

1. **Get the Dataset:**
   - Download the Titanic dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) or [seaborn-data](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/blob/master/titanic.csv)

2. **Understand the Dataset:**
   - Familiarize yourself with the structure of the dataset and its columns. The dataset includes columns such as `PassengerId`, `Pclass`, `Name`, `Age`, `Sex`, `SibSp`, `Parch`, `Fare`, and `Survived`.

3. **Tools Required:**
   - Install and import the necessary libraries:
     - `Pandas`: for data manipulation.
     - `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn`: for data visualization.
     - `NumPy` (optional for certain calculations).
    - If you are using `Jupyter notebooks` or `Google Colab` the above tools are already pre-installed 

 **Project Objectives:**

- **Data Cleaning:**
   - Check for missing or invalid values in the dataset.
   - Handle missing data (e.g., for `Age`, `Embarked`).
   - Convert categorical columns (e.g., `Sex`, `Pclass`) into meaningful representations.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Analyze the distribution of key features like age, fare, and survival status.
   - Investigate relationships between features and survival (e.g., does age, class, or gender impact survival chances?).
   - Visualize the data with different types of plots (e.g., bar charts, histograms, pairplots).

- **Key Insights:**
   - Identify patterns or trends from your analysis (e.g., which gender/class had the highest survival rate).
   - Generate actionable insights from your findings, such as what factors contributed the most to survival.

**Key Questions to Guide Your Analysis:**

 **Data Understanding:**
1. **What are the different columns in the Titanic dataset?**
   - Start by getting familiar with the dataset’s columns and data types. Use `df.info()` to see the dataset structure.
   
2. **What is the distribution of survival rates?**
   - Use a simple bar plot to show how many people survived versus how many did not.

3. **What is the age distribution of the passengers?**
   - Visualize the age distribution using a histogram to understand the passenger demographics.

4. **What percentage of passengers have missing values in key columns (e.g., Age, Cabin)?**
   - Check for missing values using `df.isnull().sum()` to identify where data is missing.
 **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:**
5. **How should you handle missing values for the Age and Embarked columns?**
   - Decide whether to fill in missing values using the mean/median or to drop rows with missing data.

6. **How do you handle categorical data (e.g., Sex, Embarked)?**
   - You may need to convert categorical columns into numerical formats using encoding techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
7. **What is the survival rate by gender?**
   - Investigate whether gender had an impact on survival by using a bar plot to compare survival rates for males and females.

8. **Did passengers in higher classes (Pclass) have better survival rates?**
   - Group the data by `Pclass` and visualize survival rates to see if class had an impact on survival chances.

9. **What is the relationship between fare and survival?**
   - Investigate how the fare paid by passengers correlates with survival chances. A scatter plot or box plot can be useful for this.

10. **Are there any relationships between family size (SibSp, Parch) and survival?**
    - Explore how the number of siblings/spouses or parents/children aboard affects the likelihood of survival. Consider using a bar chart or scatter plot.

 **Advanced Questions:**

1. **What is the relationship between the passenger’s age and their survival probability, and how does it differ by class and gender?**
   - Investigate how age impacts survival, considering different classes and gender. You could use a heatmap or a violin plot to visualize these relationships.

2. **Is there any correlation between the number of family members (SibSp + Parch) and the likelihood of survival?**
   - Explore whether having more family members aboard impacted survival chances. Create a scatter plot or use correlation metrics to understand the relationship.

3. **Did passengers who embarked at different ports (C, Q, S) have significantly different survival rates?**
   - Explore the impact of embarkation port on survival by analyzing the survival rates for each port (using `Embarked`) and visualizing the differences.

4. **Can we predict the survival rate using other demographic features like Age, Pclass, Fare, and SibSp/Parch?**
   - Perform a regression analysis or train a classification model (like logistic regression) to predict survival. Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

 **Steps to Get Started:**
1. **Load the dataset:**
   - Use `pandas.read_csv()` to load the Titanic dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

2. **Inspect the dataset:**
   - Use `df.head()` to preview the first few rows and `df.info()` to check the dataset structure, including data types and missing values.

3. **Clean the data:**
   - Handle missing values using `df.fillna()` or `df.dropna()`.
   - Encode categorical columns (e.g., `Sex`, `Embarked`) using `pd.get_dummies()` or `LabelEncoder`.

4. **Perform EDA:**
   - Start by exploring individual features (e.g., survival rate, age, fare) and visualize them using histograms and bar charts.
   - Investigate relationships between features with pairwise plots or grouped bar charts.

5. **Answer the guiding questions:**
   - Use the questions provided above to direct your analysis and ensure you cover important insights.

6. **Summarize your findings:**
   - Conclude your analysis by summarizing the key trends, patterns, and insights from the dataset, and reflect on the implications of these insights.
