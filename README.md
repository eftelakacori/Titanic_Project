Titanic Dataset Analysis - Project Guide
Project Overview:
In this project, you will explore the Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers who were aboard the Titanic. The goal of this project is to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization. By the end of the project, you will have a deeper understanding of the dataset and learn how to answer key questions related to passenger survival, demographics, and other factors.

Project Requirements:
Get the Dataset:

Download the Titanic dataset from Kaggle or seaborn-data
Understand the Dataset:

Familiarize yourself with the structure of the dataset and its columns. The dataset includes columns such as PassengerId, Pclass, Name, Age, Sex, SibSp, Parch, Fare, and Survived.
Tools Required:

Install and import the necessary libraries:
Pandas: for data manipulation.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: for data visualization.
NumPy (optional for certain calculations).
If you are using Jupyter notebooks or Google Colab the above tools are already pre-installed
Project Objectives:
Data Cleaning:

Check for missing or invalid values in the dataset.
Handle missing data (e.g., for Age, Embarked).
Convert categorical columns (e.g., Sex, Pclass) into meaningful representations.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyze the distribution of key features like age, fare, and survival status.
Investigate relationships between features and survival (e.g., does age, class, or gender impact survival chances?).
Visualize the data with different types of plots (e.g., bar charts, histograms, pairplots).
Key Insights:

Identify patterns or trends from your analysis (e.g., which gender/class had the highest survival rate).
Generate actionable insights from your findings, such as what factors contributed the most to survival.
Key Questions to Guide Your Analysis:
Data Understanding:
What are the different columns in the Titanic dataset?

Start by getting familiar with the dataset’s columns and data types. Use df.info() to see the dataset structure.
What is the distribution of survival rates?

Use a simple bar plot to show how many people survived versus how many did not.
What is the age distribution of the passengers?

Visualize the age distribution using a histogram to understand the passenger demographics.
What percentage of passengers have missing values in key columns (e.g., Age, Cabin)?

Check for missing values using df.isnull().sum() to identify where data is missing.
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:
How should you handle missing values for the Age and Embarked columns?

Decide whether to fill in missing values using the mean/median or to drop rows with missing data.
How do you handle categorical data (e.g., Sex, Embarked)?

You may need to convert categorical columns into numerical formats using encoding techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
What is the survival rate by gender?

Investigate whether gender had an impact on survival by using a bar plot to compare survival rates for males and females.
Did passengers in higher classes (Pclass) have better survival rates?

Group the data by Pclass and visualize survival rates to see if class had an impact on survival chances.
What is the relationship between fare and survival?

Investigate how the fare paid by passengers correlates with survival chances. A scatter plot or box plot can be useful for this.
Are there any relationships between family size (SibSp, Parch) and survival?

Explore how the number of siblings/spouses or parents/children aboard affects the likelihood of survival. Consider using a bar chart or scatter plot.
Advanced Questions:
What is the relationship between the passenger’s age and their survival probability, and how does it differ by class and gender?

Investigate how age impacts survival, considering different classes and gender. You could use a heatmap or a violin plot to visualize these relationships.
Is there any correlation between the number of family members (SibSp + Parch) and the likelihood of survival?

Explore whether having more family members aboard impacted survival chances. Create a scatter plot or use correlation metrics to understand the relationship.
Did passengers who embarked at different ports (C, Q, S) have significantly different survival rates?

Explore the impact of embarkation port on survival by analyzing the survival rates for each port (using Embarked) and visualizing the differences.
Can we predict the survival rate using other demographic features like Age, Pclass, Fare, and SibSp/Parch?

Perform a regression analysis or train a classification model (like logistic regression) to predict survival. Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
Steps to Get Started:
Load the dataset:

Use pandas.read_csv() to load the Titanic dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
Inspect the dataset:

Use df.head() to preview the first few rows and df.info() to check the dataset structure, including data types and missing values.
Clean the data:

Handle missing values using df.fillna() or df.dropna().
Encode categorical columns (e.g., Sex, Embarked) using pd.get_dummies() or LabelEncoder.
Perform EDA:

Start by exploring individual features (e.g., survival rate, age, fare) and visualize them using histograms and bar charts.
Investigate relationships between features with pairwise plots or grouped bar charts.
Answer the guiding questions:

Use the questions provided above to direct your analysis and ensure you cover important insights.
Summarize your findings:

Conclude your analysis by summarizing the key trends, patterns, and insights from the dataset, and reflect on the implications of these insights.
